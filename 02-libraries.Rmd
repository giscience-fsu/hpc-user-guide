# Libraries and Modules {#libraries}

## Adding Spack to your shell

Most system relevant libraries are installed via [Spack](spack.io).
They are available as environment modules.
To be able to load modules as a user, you have to add `source /opt/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh` to your `~/.bashrc` file.
You can open the file e.g. by using `nano ~/.bashrc`.
After you logged out and in again, the command below should work.

Installed libraries you can be queried via `spack find` or `module avail`.
Here is a snapshot:

```sh
spack find

## Loading libraries

Libraries can be loaded via `spack load <library>`.
Usually it is best practive to also specify the version. 
Omitting it will work unless there are multiple versions of a library available.
This will be the default very soon when the libraries are upgraded.
Don't worry, the old version will stay available.
That is one of the advantages of Spack.

First, you need to load a C compiler as most programs depend on it:

```
spack load gcc@7.3.0
```

(We use this version as `gcc@8.2.0` throwed an error when compiling R.)

Now you can for example load GDAL:

```sh
spack load gdal@2.4.0
```

You can check if it worked via 

```sh
gdalinfo --version

GDAL 2.4.0, released 2018/12/14
```

## Default libraries

It is useful to have some libraries loaded by default when logging in to the server.
Simply add them to `~/.bashrc`.

When running R for spatial analysis, the following are required:

```sh
spack load gdal@2.4.0 %gcc@7.3.0
spack load geos@3.6.2 %gcc@7.3.0
spack load proj@5.0.1 %gcc@7.3.0
spack load udunits2@2.2.24 %gcc@7.3.0
```

(It is not strictly required to load a specfic version including a compiler.
However, if multiple versions / compilers are installed there will be conficts.
So this explicit approach of loading the packages is the most robust one.)

Furthermore, I recommend the following ones (don't forget to append your version and compiler):

```sh
spack load git # version control
spack load byobu # persistent ssh
spack load neovim # editor
spack load ccache #faster package installation
```

You might wonder why you shouldn't add a R version to this list?
The answer is that it will conflict with RStudio-Server.
Whenever opening a session, your `~/.bashrc` file is sourced.
If you specify R there, it will always override what is specified in the RStudio-Server settings related to R-versions.
So yes, you always need to specifically load R when logging into a new session.
Also make sure that `GDAL` and friends are loaded in your `.bashrc` file as otherwise RStudio Server will say it cannot find them.
Fortunately, there is a small trick to save some time - check out section [create a wrapper for your project](#wrapper).

## R

All versions from v3.4.4 upwards are installed.
Query them with `spack find r` and load a specific one with `spack load r@3.5.1`.

## RStudio Server

RStudio Server is running at port 8787 (10.35.158.19:8787).

## Libraries

If you cannot find your library using `spack find`, please contact Patrick.

For your information, GDAL was built with the following driver support:

```
+curl +geos +armadillo +jpeg +openjpeg +netcdf +png +pg +sqlite3 +xml2
```

Check `spack info gdal` for more information.

### Docker

Docker is installed on the frontend only (for example to convert .html to .pdf).
To use `docker`, your user needs to be added to the "docker" group.
Please contact an Admin in case you want to use it.

## Getting Started

If you worked through all these steps, you're almost good to go.
I have some further recommendations to make your life easier.

#### byobu

`byobu` is a wrapper for your ssh session that makes it possible to close your window and not loose the command running in it.
If you start large scripts, you can safely start them in a `byobu` window and do not need to fear that they will quit once your shut down your laptop.

Basically, all you need to do is (after logging in) to run `byobu` and it will switch on a `byobu` session for you.

You can open multiple ones with `byobu -S`. 
Once you have multiple ones open, an interacive prompt will ask you which one you want to start next time.

#### radian

`radian` is an optimized wrapper for the R command line. 
You will notice the benefits compared to the default `R` once you start using it.
You need to install it via `pip` which is already installed if you installed `python`.

Usually `setuptools` needs to be upgraded first.

```sh
pip install --user --upgrade setuptools
pip install --user radian
```

Now you can either always use `radian` or set an alias in your `.bashrc` , e.g. `alias r="radian"`.
Note that `radian` only works if you have loaded R before via Spack.

#### ccache

If you load `ccache` with Spack, you will speedup source installations of R packages a lot.
(On Linux, all R packages are installed from source.)
Besides loading `ccache`, you also need to create the following file in your home directory (`~/.R/Makevars`):

(Note that you need to create the folder first, it does not exist by default (`mkdir ~/.R/`).)

```sh
VER=
CCACHE=ccache
CC=$(CCACHE) gcc -std=gnu11 $(VER)
CXX=$(CCACHE) g++$(VER)
C11=$(CCACHE) g++$(VER)
C14=$(CCACHE) g++$(VER)
FC=$(CCACHE) gfortran$(VER)
F77=$(CCACHE) gfortran$(VER)
```

When installing a package now, you will occasionally see that the `gcc` lines are prefixed with `ccache`.
This means that this `gcc` call was already executed once and is now loaded from the cache rathern than being run again.
This saves a lot of time, especially for packages that take long to install (`dplyr`, `Rcpp`, `stringi`).

#### Create a wrapper for your project {#wrapper}

Usually you might want to use a `packrat` library in a specific directory with a specific R version.
Rather than navigating there all the time by hand and loading the R version via spack, you can create an alias that does this for you.
You can of course also use this approach without packrat, just to load a specific version. 
This saves you typing `spack load r<version>`.

```
alias my-project="cd /path/to/project && spack load r@<version> && radian"
```

Put this in your `.bashrc` and save time :)
