# Troubleshooting and Cautionary Notes

## Known Issues

- The "data storage" is not mounted yet.

- Sometimes the graphic device is not accessible in an R session. This currently happens without a clear pattern and it is not clear yet which system library (or maybe a sequence of loading R packages) is causing it.

## Cautionary Notes


## FAQ

Q: I ran `sinfo` and saw that the state of the nodes is "down".
A: Please contact the admin (patrick.schratz@uni-jena.de) to resume the nodes.

Q: I ran `sinfo` and see that some nodes have status "mix" and some "alloc". What are the differences?
A: "mix" means that the node is not fully loaded and is in a mixed state between processing and being idle. "alloc" means that the node is fully allocated.

Q: I ran `spack load <library>` and got `==> Error: the constraint '['gdal@2.3.3']' matches multiple packages:`. What shall I do?
A: This means that multiple instances of this library are installed. Sometimes this is unavoidable, for example some libraries request GDAL being built against Python2, others against Python3. In this case, do the following:

1. Run `spack find --long <library>`
2. Use the number/letter combination appearing to load the package, e.g. `spack load /zms1347`.
3. If you use this library regulary, put this command into your `.bashrc` file.
4. If you experience problems during usage, try the other one.
5. If you wanna see the differences between both, do `spack find --variants <library>`
