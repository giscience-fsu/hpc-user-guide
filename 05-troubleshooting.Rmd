# Troubleshooting and Cautionary Notes

## Known Issues

- The HPC can currently only be reached via its IP (10.35.158.19) as the domain name is not yet registered at the URZ.

- The "data storage" is not mounted yet.

FAQ will appear here.

## Cautionary Notes

When writing files to disk, do not submit the job via SSH.
This is due to the fact that computations are done in memory via SSH and the resultung object is also returned in memory.
The cluster cannot write to a remote disk but only to its own file system.
