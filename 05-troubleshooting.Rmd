## FAQ

**Question**: I ran `sinfo` and saw that the state of the nodes is "down".  
**Answer**: Please contact the admin to resume the nodes.

**Question**: I ran `sinfo` and saw that some nodes have status "mix" and some "alloc". What are the differences?  
**Answer**: "mix" means that the node is not fully loaded and is in a mixed state between processing and being idle. "alloc" means that the node is fully allocated.

**Question**: I cannot install `udunits2`. What shall I do?  
**Answer**: Install it via `install.packages('udunits2', type = 'source',  configure.args='--with-udunits2-lib=<path-to-installation>'`.
For example `"--with-udunits2-include=/opt/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.2.0/udunits2-2.2.24-hupsw3nzjxtem7wlwyugyga2uh4xgieo/include/"`.

You can set this option permanently in `~/.Rprofile` in `options(configure.args = list(udunits = c(<>)))`.

**Question**: I cannot install `rgdal` | `sf`. What shall I do?  
**Answer**: All the spatial packages are a bit troublesome since they expect certain libraries in predefined directories. If this is not the case, the locations need to be given explicitly during installation. You need to install it with custom options set for `configure.args`, similar to `udunits` above.

The following works:

```r
options(
  configure.args=list(
    rgdal = c(
      "--with-proj-lib=/opt/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-zen/gcc-9.2.0/proj-5.2.0-az6mkj55zpnh6fmg2ae5wyrmhfiynxfx/lib"),
    sf = c(
      "--with-proj-lib=/opt/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-zen/gcc-9.2.0/proj-5.2.0-az6mkj55zpnh6fmg2ae5wyrmhfiynxfx/lib")
  )
)
```
